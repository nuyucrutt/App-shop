- Create an on `click` listener for the button
- Create a function `onRandomRecipe` where it will set the HTML DOM for `recipe-title` `recipe-instruction` and `recipe-image`
- The function will also set `recipe-image` width to "200px" and set `#getRecipeBtn` to be disappeared after click.
- Bind the function `onRandomRecipe` to the `click` listener button
